Style your resume!

We are going to style our online resume we created last week.
Things to keep in mind: 
    - Go above and beyond, don't be afraid to add things or do things differently.
    - Try to use as much IDs and Classes as possible, avoid using element selectors.
    - Have fun!

1. Set the body tag to the following properties:
    - margin: 0 auto;
    - max-width: 500px;

2. Choose a palette: https://colorhunt.co/
    - Background of the website (html element)
    - Main Title (h1)
    - Subtitles (h2, h3)
    - Text (p, li)
    - Note: you can combine background-color and color properties to get different styles

3. Choose a font family, import it to your HTML and assign it to the whole website.

4. Assign colors to all your elements.
    - h1 title
    - h2, h3, h4...

    - lists

5a. Set your unordered lists to a font size of 40px, and set each list item to HALF the size of its parent.
